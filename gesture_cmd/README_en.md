# 👁️ Eye Remote Control

This project is developed based on Quectel Pi H1 single-board computer, fully utilizing its powerful computing and multimedia processing capabilities to achieve low-latency, high-accuracy eye tracking functionality.

Eye Remote Control is an intelligent control system that detects user's eye state to control video playback: continue playing when eyes are open and gazing at the screen, automatically pause when eyes are closed or looking away.

![Interface Preview](assets/interface.png)

Core Features:
- Automatically play or maintain video playback when user's eyes are open and gazing at the screen
- Immediately pause current video when user closes eyes, looks away, or leaves the screen
- Supports automatic playback of next video file (cyclic playback in alphabetical order)

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Precise Eye Tracking**: Real-time eye state detection using Google MediaPipe FaceMesh with high accuracy and low latency
- **Smart Gaze Tracking**: Analyze facial landmark positions to determine if user is gazing at the screen
- **Automatic Control**: Automatically play/pause videos based on gaze state without manual intervention
- **Immersive Fullscreen Experience**: Fullscreen playback mode to reduce distractions
- **Multi-format Support**: Supports MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV and other common video formats
- **Automatic Playback Queue**: Automatically plays next video file in directory after completion
- **Dual Interface Modes**: Switch freely between windowed and fullscreen modes
- **Real-time Status Monitoring**: Display camera FPS, eye state, gaze status and other key information

## 🖥️ Interface Overview

Main interface consists of three primary areas:
1. **Camera View Area** - Real-time camera feed with facial/eye landmarks
2. **Video Playback Area** - Display current video content
3. **Control Panel Area** - Contains system status and control options

### Main Interface Elements

- 📷 **Camera Area**: Real-time camera feed with facial landmarks
- 🎬 **Video Playback Area**: Shows currently playing video
- 📊 **System Status Panel**: Displays camera, detection, eye and gaze status
- 📁 **Video Information Panel**: Shows basic video information
- 📋 **Control Guide Panel**: Displays operation instructions
- 🎮 **Control Options Panel**: Provides camera toggle, detection toggle functions
- 📁 **File Control Panel**: For selecting and managing video files

## ⚙️ Working Principle

### Eye State Detection

System uses advanced computer vision techniques for eye state detection:

1. **Facial Landmark Detection**: Uses MediaPipe FaceMesh to detect 468 facial landmarks
2. **Eye Aspect Ratio Calculation**: Standard 6-point method to calculate Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
3. **Blink Detection**: Determines blink actions through EAR threshold
4. **Eye Open/Closed State**: Combines historical states to determine eye status

### Gaze Tracking Algorithm

Gaze tracking implemented through:

1. **Eye Center Localization**: Calculates coordinates of eye centers
2. **Facial Stability Analysis**: Analyzes head stability using nose landmarks
3. **Gaze State Determination**: Uses position variance algorithm to determine stable screen gazing
4. **State Machine Tracking**: Multi-level state machine improves detection accuracy

### Video Control Logic

Intelligent video control based on:

- ✅ **Continue Playback**: When user is gazing at screen with eyes open
- ⏸️ **Pause Playback**: When user closes eyes, looks away, or leaves screen
- ▶️ **Resume Automatically**: Automatically resumes when user gazes back
- 🔁 **Auto Next**: Automatically plays next video after completion

### Automatic Playback Logic

System supports smart playlist management:

- Automatically scans video files in current directory
- Sorts by filename in alphabetical order
- Cyclic playback of all video files
- Supports seamless transition to next video

## 🚀 Installation & Execution

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the project:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd eye-remote-control
```

2. Create virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv mediapipe_env
source mediapipe_env/bin/activate
```

3. Upgrade pip:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the program:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Or use the startup script:
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

### First-time Setup

1. Ensure camera is properly connected
2. Adjust camera angle to clearly capture face
3. Maintain adequate lighting, avoid strong backlight
4. Sit at appropriate distance from camera

## 🎛️ Usage Instructions

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start Program**: Automatically enables camera and begins detection
2. **Load Video**: Click "Select Video File" to load desired video
3. **Begin Watching**: System automatically controls play/pause based on gaze
4. **Switch Modes**: Use fullscreen mode for better viewing experience

### Control Logic

| State | Behavior | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Gazing at screen + Eyes open | Continue playback | System detects you're watching |
| Closed eyes or looking away | Auto pause | Pause when leaving or closing eyes |
| Face leaves camera view | Auto pause | Pause after 1 second without face detection |

### Interface Features

#### Main Control Buttons
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Press F11 or use fullscreen button
- **Fullscreen Playback Mode**: Fullscreen video with real-time control
- **Camera Toggle**: Enable/disable camera anytime
- **Detection Toggle**: Manually enable/disable eye detection
- **Landmark Display**: Visualize eye landmarks and detection results

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Eye State Recognition Algorithm

Uses standard 6-point method to calculate Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR):
```
EAR = (|p2-p6| + |p3-p5|) / (2 * |p1-p4|)
```

Where points correspond to eye landmarks:
- p1, p4: Horizontal eye landmarks
- p2, p3, p5, p6: Vertical eye landmarks

### Gaze Determination Mechanism

Gaze determination uses composite algorithm:
1. **Position Stability Analysis**: Uses variance of eye/nose landmarks
2. **Time Series Analysis**: Filters historical data
3. **State Machine Tracking**: Finite state machine improves accuracy

### Multi-state Machine Tracking System

System uses multi-level state machines:

**Eye State Machine**:
```
open → closing → closed → opening → open
```

**Gaze State Machine**:
```
not_gazing → gazing → not_gazing
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Multi-threaded Architecture
- 🎥 **Video Capture Thread**: Handles camera input
- 🎬 **Video Playback Thread**: Manages video playback
- 👁️ **Eye Detection Module**: Dedicated image recognition

### Resource Management
- Smart memory management to prevent leaks
- Automatic release of camera/media resources
- Graceful program termination

## 📝 Best Practices

### Environment Setup
- Maintain good lighting for optimal detection
- Position camera directly facing user's face
- Avoid strong backlighting

### Usage Tips
- Maintain stable posture, avoid frequent movement
- Blinking won't affect playback, only prolonged eye closure pauses
- Brief glances away won't immediately pause

### Parameter Tuning
- Adjust thresholds in [src/eye_detector.py](src/eye_detector.py) if needed
- Fine-tune parameters based on personal habits

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
