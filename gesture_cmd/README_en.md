# Gesture-Controlled

[中文](README.md) | English

This project is a gesture-recognition–based remote video control demo implemented on the Quectel Pi H1 single-board computer.
The system captures hand images through a camera and applies AI-based hand gesture recognition algorithms to enable touchless control of video playback, progress, and volume, providing a natural and intuitive user interaction experience.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and tracking
- Support for multiple intuitive control gestures
- Remote video playback control
   - Play / Pause
   - Fast Forward / Rewind
   - Volume adjustment
- Hand status visualization (Hand detected / No hand detected)
- Single-hand natural operation with a low learning curve
- Fully local processing: low latency and no cloud dependency

**Supported Gesture Mapping**

> Please ensure that the camera is facing the user’s operation area and that the lighting conditions are stable.

|Gesture Action|Control Function|
|----------|---------|
|Open palm (5 fingers)|Play / Pause|
|Swipe right|Fast forward 5 seconds|
|Swipe leftRewind 5 seconds|
|Swipe up|Volume +5%|
|Swipe down|Volume −5%|
